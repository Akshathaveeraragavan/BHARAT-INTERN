**Project Description: SMS Spam Detection**

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). It utilizes a variety of text classification algorithms including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree. The dataset consists of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. After preprocessing and feature extraction, the models are trained and evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model, **Support Vector Machine**, achieves an accuracy of 98% and demonstrates strong performance in identifying spam messages. This project serves as a practical demonstration of text classification techniques for spam detection in real-world scenarios.
